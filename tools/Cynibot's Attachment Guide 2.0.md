If you just want to know the best attachment for each weapon and don't care about the whys and the wherefors, there's a TL;DR at the end that just puts all of this in list form

UPDATE 12/02/2020: Since there are now over 50 operators in the game, doing one big marathon test session at the beginning of each season is no longer practical. From now on, I'll be testing one weapon each day regardless of whether or not there's a new season coming up. This will allow me to spend more time testing each weapon rather than trying to rush through them all to update the guide in time for the new season. I'm hoping this will lead to more frequent updates and better, more detailed recommendations for each weapon.

Lots of people seemed to find my barrel attachment guide helpful but with the recoil changes in Grim Sky, that guide is now out of date.

So here's a new one!

First, quick definitions of a couple of terms I'll use throughout the guide.

Muzzle Climb Otherwise known as vertical recoil. How much the weapon kicks upwards when fired.

Stability Otherwise known as horizontal recoil. How much and how often the weapon kicks to the left and right.

Now, a primer on what each barrel attachment does, since the game is very bad at explaining them.

Muzzle Brake Reduces first shot recoil by 45% and centering time by 45%. This results in extremely tight 2-3 shot groupings and the quicker centering time allows for less time between bursts. This attachment has absolutely no effect on stability. The in-game description makes it sound like this attachment only helps with single fire weapons like pistols and DMRs but this is not the case.

Flash Hider Reduces first shot recoil by 37.5%, reduces centering time by 30% and improves stability by 5%. A common misconception about the flash hider is that it removes the white indicators on your opponent's screen that show which direction you're firing from and that it hides your bullet trails. Only the suppressor does these things. The flash hider does, however, divert the muzzle flash of your weapon sideways, so that it doesn't obscure your view of your target. Some people find this feature very useful, others don't notice muzzle flash enough for it to be a problem. The flash hider is a universally viable barrel attachment, giving you most of the benefits of the muzzle brake and some of the benefit of the compensator. It's not always the best choice, but it's never a bad choice. You could put it on every automatic weapon in the game and have no issues at all.

Compensator The compensator has no effect on muzzle climb but improves stability by 17.75%. This results in more vertical kick but a narrower and more predictable recoil pattern. This makes the compensator very useful on weapons that have low muzzle climb and/or poor stability.

Suppressor Suppressors reduce the noise made by your weapon, hide your bullet trails, and removes the indicators on your opponent's screen that show where you're firing from, but they also have zero recoil benefits and reduce your weapon's damage. With the recoil changes made in Grim Sky, the lack of recoil mitigation is less of a deal breaker than it used to be. Is the suppressor a viable weapon attachment now? Yes. Is it better than using a muzzle brake/flash hider/compensator? Not really. The unpredictable recoil and lower damage means that you'll be scoring fewer hits, while at the same time needing more hits to secure the kill.

Extended Barrel This attachment is borderline useless. For a full explanation of why, see Rogue 9's YouTube video on the extended barrel.

After the first guide, I got a lot of messages asking for recommendations for other attachments like grips and sights, so here they are.

Grips The vertical grip reduces recoil by about 25%, while the angled grip decreases the time it takes to aim down your weapon's sights by 40%. While the angled grip sounds great on paper, it doesn't really fit the pace of Siege's gameplay. The vast majority of gunfights in Siege begin with both players already aiming down their sights, and so the angled grip is only useful when you've been caught off guard and don't have your gun up, ready for the fight. I'll take a 25% recoil reduction in every gunfight over 40% quicker aiming in some gunfights any day, and I recommend you do as well. The only exceptions are Frost's 9mm C1, which doesn't have the option for a vertical grip, and the BOSG shotgun. The BOSG has too much recoil for quick follow up shots, even with the vertical grip.

Sights This one is largely personal preference. There are plays you can make with a holo or reflex sight that you simply can't make with an ACOG and vice-versa. If you have a fast playstyle and enjoy being the first man through the door, the ACOG would probably be a poor choice. If you're a more patient and methodical player, the ACOG will give you a big advantage when holding angles and in medium-long range fights. It's a common misconception that the ACOG increases recoil. The recoil is the same, but looks and feels stronger because of the magnification of the sight. The only sight that is always a bad choice is the red dot, as it's inferior to the reflex in every way.

Fookin' Laser Sights Reduces hipfire spread by 25%. Laser sights shouldn't generally be used as they can give your position away in multiple ways. Opponents can see the red dot and use it to work out where you are, and the red glare of the sight itself can make it easier to see you when you otherwise would've blended into the background. There are some weapons that are worth putting a laser sight on; all shotguns except the BOSG and TCSG12 should have one, as shotguns are trash and need all the help they can get to tighten their absurdly wide spreads. Shield operators should always have a lazer sight on their pistols. Shield operators rely heavily on hip fire, so get a lot of benefit from a laser sight, and you don't need to worry about the laser giving your position away, since shields make so much noise that your opponent will hear you before they see you.

Methodology For anyone curious about how I test the weapons, I play a solo t-hunt round on Disarm Bomb/Protect Hostage with each attachment for every weapon. So, for example, I played three rounds of Disarm Bomb with the L85. One using the compensator, one with the flash hider, and one with the muzzle brake. I use Disarm Bomb because it offers almost three times as many targets to practice on as the other attacking T-Hunt modes. I then recommend the best attachment based on recoil predictability, how easy the muzzle climb is to control, and how easy it was to land headshots. Some people like to test recoil by just shooting at a wall and looking at the patterns. While you can draw some conclusions from this kind of testing, this method has too many limitations. In a multiplayer game, you'll be firing at moving targets that are shooting back at you, at variable ranges, while on the move yourself. Mag dumping into a wall isn't gonna give you much of an idea of how effective the weapon will be in those conditions. It's shooting range vs live combat.

Results Now that that's out of the way, here are my recommendations for the optimal barrel attachment for each weapon.

L85 (Sledge, Thatcher)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

The L85 is comfortable with any combination of optics and barrels but I did notice that the first shot kick would occasionally send the rest of my bullets over my target's head when pairing the compensator with an ACOG. Muzzle climb is easier to control with 1x sights so if you run a holo or reflex you can run the compensator quite comfortably. This will stop the L85 drifting off to the left when you hold the trigger for too long.

SMG-11 (Sledge, Smoke, Mute, Amaru)

Flash Hider

You'd think the compensator would work wonders on a weapon like this. You'd be so wrong. If you use anything other than the flash hider, your first bullet will be on target and then the rest are gonna land on the moon somewhere. The initial kick on the SMG-11 is crazy. The flash hider brings it under control to the point you comfortably fire in full auto up to around 9m. Beyond that, you're gonna have to burst fire. The faster re-centering time of the flash hider will help here as well.

AR33 (Thatcher)

Flash Hider

Look, I love the L85 as much as you do but don't sleep on the AR33; it's a headshot machine. This rifle handles like a dream no matter what optic and barrel you put on it. As always, when there's no clear winner, flash hider is always the safe pick.

G36c (Ash, Iana)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

A moderater fire rate and low recoil makes the G36c another weapon that's very comfortable to use, regardless of what you put on it. Hitting headshots and longer ranges was noticeably easier with the flash hider, so pair that with an ACOG. If you're running a 1x sight then we're not gonna worry as much about long-range accuracy so take the compensator to minimize the G36c's natural rightward drift.

R4-C (Ash)

Compensator

Every no-brain Ash main's favorite crutch weapon. The R4-C has a high fire rate and a habit of violently and randomly kicking to the right during sustained fire. The compensator solves this nicely and the first-shot kick shouldn't cause you any problems as long as you keep the fight at short-medium range, where the R4-C excels.

556xi (Thermite)

Flash Hider

Thermite's rifle couldn't give a shit about your compensator, it's gonna bounce around on full auto no matter what you put on it. Since the compensator can't correct this weapon's weakness, you might as well play to its strengths and focus on maximizing its burst-fire accuracy. Take the flash hider to make sure you put those first 3 high-damage rounds on target and finish the fight before the barrel gets bored and wanders off.

F2 (Twitch)

Muzzle Brake

I don't know why Ubi thought a slightly smaller magazine was going to balance this absolute death machine. 26 rounds is more than enough for the F2 to melt you and everyone you've ever loved into a cloud of red mist. The FAMAS becomes very unstable under sustained fire but the muzzle climb is far too uncomfortable for the compensator and even the flash hider struggles. Use the muzzle brake to help tame the vicious first-shot kick. You'll have to deal with some instability but as long as you stick to short-medium range fights this weapon is still devastating.

417 (Twitch, Lion)

Muzzle Brake

0Ts-03 (Glaz)

Muzzle Brake

6P41 (Fuze, Finka)

Flash Hider

FH wins by default.

AK-12 (Fuze, Ace)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Reflex/Compensator

I wonder how much more popular Fuze would be if more people realized how good the AK-12 is. It starts to bounce around after the first few shots, so putting a compensator on it makes sense, but the high rate of fire can make the muzzle climb difficult to manage when using an ACOG. Take the flash hider as a compromise but feel free to run the compensator when using a 1x sight.

AUG A2 (IQ, Wamai)

Flash Hider

The compensator is mostly wasted on this weapon since the recoil is almost entirely vertical. The AUG can be comfortably fired on full auto with the flash hider so take that to bring the down the muzzle climb.

552 Commando (IQ)

Flash Hider

I just can't find a setup that makes this gun feel nice to use. There's an uncomfortable amount of muzzle climb to deal with when using the compensator but the 552 will start pulling off to the right after the first 3 rounds if you use anything else. You've got 48 damage per round to work with so use the flash hider to keep the barrel down and make sure those first 3 rounds are all you need.

G8A1 (IQ, Amaru)

Compensator

Despite its high RPM, the G8A1 is very comfortable regardless of loadout. Put a compensator on it and you can empty the whole magazine without losing control. If you must use the angled grip, run a flash hider to balance out the added muzzle climb. Normally I wouldn't even mention the angled grip but I acknowledge that I may be the only person who still runs a vertical on this thing.

C8-SFW (Buck)

Muzzle Brake

The lack of a vertical grip means the C8 kicks like an angry fetus on the first shot so you really need the benefits of a flash hider or muzzle brake to make it viable. This does create some stability issues on longer bursts but you just can't run a compensator on it. You'll have to pull back so hard on your mouse to keep the barrel down that you'll inevitably end up pulling slightly left or right and cancelling out the effects of the compensator anyway. This is one of those rare cases where the added muzzle climb control from the brake is worth sacrificing the benefits of the flash hider.

CAMRS (Buck)

Muzzle Brake

MK17-CQB (Blackbeard)

Flash Hider

Beardy McGamebreaker's rifle would be completely useless in the hands of any other operator. You'd think the brutally slow rate of fire would make controlling it easy but it just randomly kicks hard left whenever it wants, even with a compensator. Not point trying to stabilize the Mk17 so just use the flash hider to manage the muzzle climb. Who needs firepower when you've got a bulletproof face, anyway?

SR-25 (Blackbeard)

Muzzle Brake

PARA-308 (Capitao)

Flash Hider

The PARA actually has more recoil than you think. It's got a fair amount of kick on the first shot but the rate of fire is fairly low so keeping the barrel down is a breeze. It stays pretty stable as well, even under full auto, so there's no real need for a compensator. When in doubt, the flash hider is the shout, but there's really no wrong answer here.

M249 (Capitao)

Scope/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

The M249 has a relatively low RPM so I was expecting the compensator to be the standout here but I found my aim being frequently thrown off by the first shot recoil when using the scope and compensator together. As is always the case, switching to a 1x sight made it easier to control that initial muzzle climb and eliminated the problem. The LMGs aren't really tuned for long range precision but if you do want to use the scope, pair it with a flash hider and exercise some trigger discipline.

M249 SAW (Gridlock)

Scope/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

It has come to my attention that despite being the same weapon with different feeding mechanisms, Capitao and Gridlock's M249 LMGs actually have slightly different recoil behaviours. Both have identical levels of muzzle climb but Gridlock's M249 isn't actually as stable as Cap's, meaning more random jumps to the left/right than its belt-fed cousin. Despite this difference, my attachment recommendations remain the same. The compensator allows for consistent recoil when firing full-auto, but accurate long-range bursts aren't really possible without a flash hider, so it's a must when using the scope. I still believe magnification sights are mostly wasted on the LMGs, as their wide recoil patterns limit their potential for precision shooting.

Type-89 (Hibana)

Flash Hider

With extremely poor stability and a 20 round magazine, the Typer-89 seems designed to punish poor trigger discipline. This weapon pulls heavily to the right no matter what you put on it, so use the flash hider to keep the muzzle down and fire in bursts to maintain stability. Don't even think of touching the muzzle brake unless you want your recoil pattern to look like a join-the-dots puzzle.

Bearing 9 (Hibana, Echo)

Flash Hider

Much like the SMG-11, you won't hit anything beyond short range on full auto so use the flash hider for when you need to tap fire to hit something further away.

C7E (Jackal)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

There's a strong argument for this being the best weapon in the game. Low recoil, high RPM, high damage and fast reload. The C7E's only weakness is its occasional random left/right kicks under sustained fire. These are infrequent enough that I wouldn't say it's worth running the compensator unless you're using a 1x sight where you won't feel the muzzle climb as much.

PDW9 (Jackal)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

There are no bad picks here. The PDW9 has barely any recoil no matter what you throw on it. As is often the case, the ACOG feels a little more comfortable when paired with a flash hider but there's no reason not to run a compensator on this otherwise.

T-95 LSW (Ying)

Compensator

The flash hider and muzzle brake will give the T-95 accurate 3-4 shot bursts but that kind of defeats the point of having an 80-round magazine. The compensator requires a little extra effort to keep the barrel down but it's not uncomfortable at all and it'll allow you to go full auto without your crosshair jumping all over the place after the first 4 bullets.

LMG-E (Zofia)

Compensator

Like most of the LMGs, Zofia's machine gun has a very wide recoil pattern, with frequent jumps to the left and right. The compensator doesn't eliminate this problem by a long shot but it keeps you reasonably accurate up to medium range and the muzzle climb is manageable with any optic without the need for a flash hider.

M762 (Zofia)

ACOG/Flash Hider or Holo/Compensator

Those big 7.62 rounds give Zofia's AK a fair amount of recoil, even with that moderate fire rate. When running an ACOG, the flash hider is needed to bring the muzzle climb down to comfortable levels. The M762 has an annoying amount of pull to the right as well though, so I found the weapon to be at it's most effective with the compensator/holo combo.

Mk 14 EBR (Dokkaebi)

Muzzle Brake

V308 (Lion)

Flash Hider

The V308 is labelled as an assault rifle in-game but handles more like an LMG, and not because of that drum mag. The lack of stability makes it tougher to land hits at longer ranges, as it's impossible to control those random jumps to the left/right. Normally this would be a job for the compensator but the V308 feels significantly more comfortable to use with a flash hider. While that 50-round mag makes it tempting to start spraying, a little trigger discipline gets the best out of this weapon.

Spear.308 (Finka)

Flash Hider

Finka's Spear is very manageable with a compensator but the high stability of the rifle means you don't really need one. You can run a flash hider to take away most of the venom from that first shot kick without worrying about random left/right jumps as long as you don't make a habit of firing more than 8 or so rounds at a time. Who cares about recoil anyway when you can just take a shot of red bull and fire full auto with lazer accuracy whenever you want?

AR-15.50 (Maverick)

Muzzle Brake

M4 (Maverick)

Flash Hider

Maverick's custom M4 is one of the most well-rounded and reliable weapons in the game. Moderate damage, moderate fire rate, moderate recoil, standard mag size. As you'd expect, the middle-of-the-road barrel attachment suits this gun best, as the muzzle climb is slightly too strong to comfortably use a compensator but not strong enough to warrant a muzzle brake.

FMG9 (Smoke, Nokk)

Flash Hider

There's no wrong choice here. The FMG9 has a lot of muzzle climb for an SMG but it's not uncomfortable by any means. It loses some stability after the 3rd shot so the flash hider helps keep it on target during longer bursts.

MP5k (Mute, Wamai)

Flash Hider

The MP5k has a lot of kick on the first shot so the muzzle brake is not a bad call but it also becomes unstable after the 3rd round. As is often the case, the flash hider is a good compromise.

UMP45 (Castle, Pulse)

Compensator

This one isn't even a contest. The UMP's low fire rate creates almost no muzzle climb at all so there's really no point in using a flash hider or muzzle brake. This weapon becomes significantly less stable on full auto so all the more reason to use a compensator.

MP5 (Doc, Rook, Oryx)

Flash Hider

Really struggling to find a difference between the flash hider and muzzle brake here. Both offer very accurate bursts up to 3 shots and then consistently pull to the right. If in doubt, flash hider.

P90 (Doc, Rook)

Muzzle Brake

When the game says this weapon is "best used in close quarters" it's not fucking kidding. A nightmarish combination of high first-shot kick and a 970rpm fire rate means you'll need to fight hard to keep the P90's barrel down, even with the help of a muzzle brake. And if you think this uncomfortable muzzle climb is at least balanced out by a stable recoil pattern, think again. Regardless of which attachments you use, the P90 will begin to dance all over the place after the 3rd shot, which is a big problem when you when you need a minimum of FIVE body shots just to kill a 1 armor operator. Factor in other damage-reducing variables such as penetration, limb shots and damage drop-off and you are looking at a horrendously long time-to-kill, even if you land all your shots. Using the P90 is therefore very simple; you land a headshot, or you die. To maximise your chances of success with this weapon, slap a muzzle brake on it, take fights at short range if you can, and focus solely on landing a headshot. Take the ACOG off as well. This weapon just isn't built for it.

9x19vsn (Kapkan, Tachanka)

Compensator

Buff the MP5's damage, take away its ACOG (please for the love of god, Ubi, take away its ACOG), and you get the 9x19vsn. This SMG has a very similar recoil pattern and RPM to the MP5, with the key differences being the lack of an ACOG option and the availability of a compensator. Where the MP5 lacks any attachment to stop it pulling to the right under sustained fire, the compensator tames the 9x19vsn quite nicely.

416-c (Jäger)

Flash Hider

One of those weapons that just doesn't feel right with anything but a flash hider. The 416-c has a fair amount of muzzle climb, poor stability and an obnoxious muzzle flash. The flash hider doesn't do a great deal to help stabilize the rifle but it at least makes it comfortable to use at anything up to long range.

MP7 (Bandit)

Muzzle Brake

No matter what you put on it, the MP7 will either have too much muzzle climb or too much horizontal recoil to be effective beyond medium range. The flash hider doesn't quite bring the muzzle climb down to comfortable levels and doesn't do much to stabilize the weapon either, so by trying to solve both problems you end up solving neither of them. Your best bet is to pick your poison; stablize that RNG recoil with a compensator or bring the barrel down with a muzzle brake. Since most players don't have the recoil control needed to tame the MP7's muzzle climb, the muzzle brake is the safe pick.

9mm C1 (Frost)

None

The suppressor's benefits aren't worth the damage nerf and the extended barrel is so useless that it's not even worth the tiny risk of the longer barrel sticking out around corners and giving your position away. You're better off with no barrel attachment at all.

MPX (Valkyrie, Warden)

Compensator

Really no reason not to use a compensator here. Muzzle climb is very comfortable so the compensator turns an already stable weapon into a lazer beam.

M12 (Caveira)

Flash Hider

The M12 has so little recoil that it really doesn't matter which barrel you use. The low RPM means you don't need a muzzle brake to keep the barrel down so use the flash hider to take the edge of the small stability penalty that you'll suffer on longer bursts.

Vector .45 ACP (Mira, Goyo)

Flash Hider

Okay, the Vector, easy right? Compensator. Case closed. Well, no; sadly it's not as simple as that. On paper the compensator makes sense; the Vector has a high rate of fire, low first-shot kick and poor stability when emptying the mag. The problem is that even though the compensator does make the Vector a little easier to handle after the first 4 rounds, the weapon is so unstable that it's probably not gonna be the difference between you hitting and missing your shots. It's like putting your seatbelt on during a plane crash. Yes, it's helping, but it's probably not gonna change the end result much. You're better off playing to the Vector's strengths instead of trying to balance its weaknesses. Take advantage of its insane RPM and short burst accuracy by focusing entirely on headshots. Use the flash hider to help with this. There's no point aiming for the torso when using a weapon that needs half a dozen shots to kill someone but throws a tantrum if you try and shoot more than 4 at a time.

T-5 SMG (Lesion, Melusi)

Flash Hider

If the rumors are true about the next defender having access to an ACOG-equipped T-5, then this thing is gonna need a big nerf. High innate stability means the compensator isn't really necessary so take the flash hider to deal with its heavy first-shot kick.

Scorpion EVO 3 A1 (Ela)

Compensator

2 shots. That's how long the Scorpion keeps its stability for. The easiest way to understand how this weapon works not is to look at its recoil chart. With the muzzle brake, the first two rounds are fairly accurate, followed by a complete loss of stability to the point that the weapon is uncontrollable. With the compensator, that stability drop-off actually starts immediately, but the effect is much less severe. The flash hider, as always, is a middle-ground between the two. The Scorpion has low damage and a high RPM, so going for headshots makes sense, but if you don't find the head with your first two bullets, you're probably not gonna find it at all. The compensator keeps the gun just stable enough that you can spray people down with body shots at short-medium range, so I recommend using that, aiming for the upper torso, and praying to RNGesus that you get a lucky headshot.

K1A (Vigil)

Flash Hider

No wrong answers here. Low muzzle climb and high stability means the K1A is accurate with pretty much any configuration. Feels most comfortable with the flash hider.

ALDA 5.56 (Maestro)

Compensator

The compensator was never viable back when the ALDA had an ACOG. That's no longer the case. Once you get over the heavy first shot kick, the ALDA can be accurately fired on full auto. Useful trait for a weapon with an 80-round magazine and the highest DPS of any defender weapon.

Mx4 Storm (Alibi)

Compensator

Like many of the SMGs, the Mx4 loses stability beyond the 3rd round. For such a high RPM gun, however, it has surprisingly little muzzle climb, so you can comfortably use a compensator to address this.

SPSMG9 (Clash)

Flash Hider

FH wins by default.

AK-74M (Nomad)

ACOG/Muzzle Brake or Holo/Compensator

Considering its moderate damage and low fire rate, this gun just has way too much recoil. Even though Nomad's Airjab launcher is not an underbarrel attachment like Buck's skeleton key, she's unable to use a vertical grip with her AK. This gives her a lot of muzzle climb to deal with on top of absolutely terrible stability when firing more than 3 rounds at a time. Using a compensator is the only way to maintain accuracy during sustained fire, so you should attach one when running a 1x optic, where muzzle climb is much less of an issue. However, the lack of a vertical grip means the muzzle climb is way too uncomfortable when using an ACOG. While the flash hider is a big help with the muzzle climb, the AK is so unstable that the 5% stability buff you get from this attachment provides almost no noticeable benefit. For this reason, I say screw it and just run the muzzle brake to get that extra little bit of vertical recoil control.

ARX200 (Nomad, Iana)

Flash Hider

If you're ever in doubt about just how useful the vertical grip is, just feel the difference in this weapon between Nomad and Iana. Once again, for no properly explained reason, Nomad can't use a vertical grip on her weapons, so the ARX200 has a considerable amount of muzzle climb and pulls noticeably to the right. There's not much you can do about this beyond using a flash hider to pull the muzzle climb down to manageable levels. Iana, being the genius that she is, has worked out how to attach a grip to her ARX200, and this transforms it into one of the best weapons in the game. The instability is much less severe and the muzzle climb becomes comfortable enough that you can use it with pretty much any barrel. While you could run a compensator on Iana's ARX, I recommend the flash hider, given the small magazine size and high damage. Why worry about going full auto when you can put down any operator in the game with 3 rounds.

AUG A3 (Kaid)

Flash Hider

High stability with only moderate muzzle climb means Kaid's AUG works with pretty much anything. When in doubt, flash hider.

F90 (Gridlock)

Compensator

I know all you adderral junkies won't touch Gridlock cos she's a thic girl but you are missing on a top tier weapon in the F90. Yes, 38 damage is very low for an AR but my goodness this thing handles like a dream. Its only bad habit is a slight pull to the right which is all but fixed by using a compensator. People are gonna think you're using a recoil macro as you empty your entire magazine on a dime.

Commando 9 (Mozzie)

Flash Hider

The Commando 9 has a very weird and unique recoil pattern. With most weapons, the muzzle climbs at a consistent rate, with little to no variation in how much the gun jumps between shots, and the randomness comes from how often and how severely the gun jumps to the left or right. With the Commando it's almost the opposite; the gun has a very narrow recoil pattern, but there's a large amount of variation in how fast the barrel climbs between shots. This can cause random jumps that make it very difficult to pin down how much you need to pull down on your mouse to counter the muzzle climb. Since no other weapon in the game seems to do this, I'm not really sure what to make of it. All I can tell you is that I felt most comfortable using the Commando 9 with the flash hider.

P10 Roni (Mozzie)

Compensator

This one's easy. Even with the high RoF there's barely any muzzle climb to worry about so slapping a compensator on the Roni turns it into a lazer beam.

Now I wouldn't be doing good science if I didn't acknowledge the limitations of my tests. While T-Hunt is definitely better than shooting at walls for testing a weapon, it's obviously not as good as actual multiplayer, where the targets move much more unpredictably. However, in multiplayer, most of the time you'll only get one or two targets to test your weapon on per round. If I tested the weapons like that, we'd probably be into the next season by the time I felt comfortable making recommendations for all the weapons. If I find that one of my recommendations doesn't hold up under multiplayer conditions, I will update the guide accordingly, so it may be worth checking back occasionally to see if there have been any changes. Also, if I might humblebrag for a moment, while my recoil control is very mediocre by Diamond/Competitive standards, it's still probably going to be better than most players, particularly players who are new to shooters or new to PC and may not be used to dragging their mouse down to compensate for recoil. If you try one of my recommendations and find yourself struggling to manage the muzzle climb, I'd encourage you to switch to an attachment that better mitigates muzzle climb. For example, if you find that you simply can't handle 556xi with the compensator, by all means switch to the flash hider, and then the muzzle brake if it's still too much for you. You'll have to deal with more instability, but having a straight and predictable recoil pattern isn't gonna help you if all your bullets are flying over your opponents head. Finally, all this testing was done on PC. Recoil is handled differently on console so I have no idea how well these results will hold up on other platforms.

Above all else, remember that there's always an element of personal preference in attachment choice (apart from the extended barrel, that piece of crap is objectively useless). If you disagree with any of my results, I'm not about to tell you you're wrong. Hell, I'd be amazed if you tested all the weapons yourself and chose the same attachments as me for every single weapon. I encourage you to use this guide as a starting point, and make adjustments over time based on your experience and personal preferences.

One last thing. My friends tell me I'm shit at promoting myself, and that I'm a dumbass for not including a link to my tiny YouTube channel in the last guide, so here it is. I upload pretty much exclusively Siege highlights.
